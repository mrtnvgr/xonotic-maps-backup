Now start moving the mouse much much slower to the left, and keep doing so until you (hopefully :)) reach the other ledge. It will take some trial and error to find the best speed at which you should move the mouse, but once you get a hang of it all it should be easy. Now give it a try! Good luck! Move to the next level once you can cross the ledge 5 times in a row."
